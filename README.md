## Feature Breakdown

### 1. User Management
This feature allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles securely. It ensures proper authentication and personalized user experiences.

### 2. Property Management
Users can create, update, and delete property listings. This feature enables hosts to manage their properties and showcase them to potential guests.

### 3. Booking System
The booking system allows users to reserve properties for specific dates. It manages availability, check-in/check-out details, and ensures smooth reservations.

### 4. Payment Processing
This feature handles transactions between users and hosts. It records payment details securely and ensures seamless financial operations.

### 5. Review System
Users can leave ratings and comments for properties they have stayed at. This helps maintain transparency and assists other users in making informed decisions.
## API Security

### 1. Authentication
Users must log in with secure credentials to access the system. This ensures that only authorized users can interact with the application.

### 2. Authorization
Different roles (e.g., admin, host, guest) have access to specific resources and actions. This prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data and actions.

### 3. Rate Limiting
API requests are monitored to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks. This helps maintain service availability and performance.

### 4. Data Protection
Sensitive user data, such as passwords and payment information, are encrypted and stored securely. This prevents data breaches and builds user trust.

### 5. Secure Transactions
Payment operations use secure protocols and verification to protect financial information. This ensures that transactions are safe and reliable.
